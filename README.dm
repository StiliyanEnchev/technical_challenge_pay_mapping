# 💼 Payroll Data Validator

Automated Python tests to ensure payroll data consistency and integrity across multiple sources.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project validates payroll data between three sources:

- **GTN file** – Payroll input file  
- **Payrun file** – Processed payroll output  
- **mapping.json** – Defines how GTN pay elements map to Payrun columns  

The goal is to guarantee data integrity, accurate mappings, and reliable payroll calculations before further processing.

2. **Mapping accuracy**  
   - All GTN pay elements are properly mapped  
   - All Payrun pay elements have corresponding GTN mappings  

3. **Data integrity**  
   - All pay element values are numeric
